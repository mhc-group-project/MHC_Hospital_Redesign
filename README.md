### Neil's Feature Summary- FAQ
FAQ feature consists of 2 entities with full CRUD functionality with many to many relationship
- [x] FAQ -the admin can list, create, uodate,delete and also ulist a particular faq from a category
- [x] FAQ Categories - The public user can view the list of Faq category and can view all the faqs listed under that category.The admin user has full CRUD acces.

Since the hospital has a lot of information and links displayed on their webpage which the user has to navigate, there will be a lot of common frequently asked questions which the user would like to get access of at one place rather than reading through and navigating the entire website. In order for the user to access the right information, the Faqs are are nested inside their respective categories inorderfor the user to find the information they need based on the category.
