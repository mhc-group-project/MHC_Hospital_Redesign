            Testing for COVID-19 is based on a clinical assessment of each person. The priority as a health system is for testing to inform clinical and public health management.

        <h2>Supporting Cultural Diversity</h2>
        <p>
            We have made a difference to patient care on Manitoulin. Together, we’ve standardized care practices around wound care and IV therapy, for example. We’ve improved care processes such as e-referrals between local care providers and, with our Physiotherapy Partner, we’ve expanded those services right here, at home.
